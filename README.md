# movie-sentiment-analysis using BERT transformer 

This is an application that we developed to be able to analyze movie sentiments into two categories: positive and negative .
We also added a function that calculates the sentiment score so that we can see if our sentiment is positive , it is positive by what score . 
The barbie image in this project is the sample movie that we used and users will be typing their reviews based on the Barbie movie 
The requirements.txt contains all the libraries and tools that we used for the project . 

to run this project one must run:
!streamlit run app.py 

What to do in the streamlit app 
Enter a movie review 
click on analyze 
then it returns :
.the sentiment score 
.sentiment score class(positive or negative )
.and the sentiment classsification of the review
